This project involves testing the Android 11 Contacts application using Java and the Appium framework for UI automation.
We did this project with the mentorship of Netcetera.

Our team started with session-based testing to identify any bugs or issues in the Contacts application. This initial phase 
helped us ensure that the application was functioning correctly.

Next, we researched the Robot Testing Pattern and structured our project to facilitate easier future development. We defined
bots for various interactions with contacts and created a driver class that is used whenever a bot is executed based on the tests.

We developed the following tests to validate the functionality of the Contacts application:

- Contact creation
- Contact deletion
- Contact search
- Sorting contacts by last name

Finally, we researched how to use the Appium reporter plugin and image comparison plugin. We successfully implemented these plugins
to enhance our testing project.
